Akan Name Generator

 Project Description

The Akan Name Generator is a web application that calculates the day of the week a user was born and assigns them an Akan name based on their gender. Akan names are derived from Ghanaian culture, where children are traditionally named according to the day of the week they were born.

This interactive application allows users to input their birthdate and gender, then displays their corresponding Akan name along with the day of the week they were born.

 Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

 User Stories and Scenarios

**Story 1: User enters valid birthdate and gender**
- **Given** the user is on the Akan Name Generator page
- **When** the user enters a valid day (1-31), month (1-12), year, and selects a gender
- **And** clicks "Find My Akan Name"
- **Then** the application displays the correct Akan name
- **And** shows the day of the week they were born

**Story 2: User enters invalid day**
- **Given** the user is on the Akan Name Generator page
- **When** the user enters a day outside the range of 1-31
- **Then** the application displays an alert message
- **And** does not calculate the Akan name

**Story 3: User enters invalid month**
- **Given** the user is on the Akan Name Generator page
- **When** the user enters a month outside the range of 1-12
- **Then** the application displays an alert message
- **And** does not calculate the Akan name

**Story 4: User submits form without selecting gender**
- **Given** the user is on the Akan Name Generator page
- **When** the user enters date information but does not select a gender
- **And** clicks "Find My Akan Name"
- **Then** the application displays an alert message requesting gender selection

**Story 5: User enters invalid date for a specific month**
- **Given** the user is on the Akan Name Generator page
- **When** the user enters February 30th or any other invalid date
- **Then** the application displays an alert message
- **And** does not calculate the Akan name

 How It Works

 The Day Calculation Formula

The application uses the following formula to calculate the day of the week:

```
d = ((CC/4 - 2*CC - 1) + (5*YY/4) + (26*(MM+1)/10) + DD) mod 7
```

Where:
- **CC** = Century (first two digits of the year)
- **YY** = Year (last two digits of the year)
- **MM** = Month
- **DD** = Day
- **mod** = Modulus operator (%)

### Akan Names

| Day       | Male Name | Female Name |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Sunday    | Kwasi     | Akosua      |
| Monday    | Kwadwo    | Adwoa       |
| Tuesday   | Kwabena   | Abenaa      |
| Wednesday | Kwaku     | Akua        |
| Thursday  | Yaw       | Yaa         |
| Friday    | Kofi      | Afua        |
| Saturday  | Kwame     | Ama         |


 Code Quality

- ✅ Proper indentation and formatting
- ✅ Clear and descriptive variable names
- ✅ Comprehensive code comments
- ✅ Modular functions with single responsibilities
- ✅ Input validation and error handling
- ✅ Follows JavaScript best practices

## Testing

To test the application:

1. **Valid inputs**: Try entering your actual birthdate
2. **Invalid day**: Try entering 32 or 0
3. **Invalid month**: Try entering 13 or 0
4. **Invalid dates**: Try February 30th or April 31st
5. **Missing gender**: Submit without selecting gender
6. **Leap years**: Test with leap year dates (e.g., Feb 29, 2000)

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome (recommended)
